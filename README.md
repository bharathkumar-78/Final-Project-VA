## Introduction
The Olympic Games bring athletes together from around the world to compete in various sports. This project focuses on analyzing trends in Olympic medal distribution based on country, gender, and sport. The app provides interactive visualizations, allowing users to explore how different nations and athletes have performed over time. Filters for year, sport, and medal type make it easy to focus on specific areas of interest, like gender participation or country success.

## Data/Operation Abstraction Design

This project utilizes the Olympic Data , which contains information on athletes, sports, and medals from 1896 to 2016. The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and standardized for seamless analysis. The app, available at Streamlit , provides interactive filters for exploring trends by year, sport, and medal type. Visualizations include gender participation trends, medal distribution by country, and athlete metrics like height and weight. Built with Streamlit and Plotly, the app ensures a user-friendly experience, making it easy to uncover patterns and insights in Olympic history.

## Future Works

In the future, the app could analyze individual athlete performances, study gender participation trends in more detail, and add predictive models to forecast future medal counts. It serves as a starting point for exploring Olympic data and understanding global sports trends
